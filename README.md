Hi there!

This repo contains all the files for the egghead.io beginners guide to react class linked here:

https://egghead.io/lessons/react-a-beginners-guide-to-react-outro

The class was a refresher course for me, but well worth my time. It does a good job of going through the fundamentals if you are new to React or just haven't worked with it in a while.

Check out some other cool projects I've built:
